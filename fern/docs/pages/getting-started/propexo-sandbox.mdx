# Sample Integration

## Overview
Sometimes Propexo customers are waiting for approval from their PMS provider, but still want to get started with development against the Propexo API. In that case, we offer a sample Buildium integration to get you started. This integration is not meant to be used in production, but rather as a way to get started with the Propexo API.

The following is a step-by-step guide to adding your first Property Management System (PMS) integration to your Propexo account. To complete this guide, you will need to have a Propexo account and your own PMS credentials for one of our supported integrations. If you do not have a Propexo account, please contact our [Sales team](https://www.propexo.com/schedule-a-call).
