# Selectively Enabling Properties

Some PMSs give access to many more properties than you may actually want to have access to.
It's common to have one of your customers want to run your product on only a select list of their properties.
In this case, it can be cumbersome to sift through data from all their properties when you only need a small amount of relevant data.

To resolve this common situation, we support explicitly enabling and disabling ingestion of property data.
We offer the ability to configure this both via our API and our website.

<Callout intent="info">
By default, an integration has all properties set to be enabled.
This can be changed during integration creation and updates in both the API and the website.
</Callout>

## How it works

When creating an integration (via the API or website), you'll have the option to not ingest properties by default.
The default setting is to always ingest all properties, but if this option is chosen, we will not populate any data for any properties to start.

Once an initial sync has finished, a list of the available properties will be available to inspect via the API and the website.
You can selectively enable and disable properties as appropriate for your use case.
After this, subsequent syncs will ingest data for the properties that remain enabled, and those listed as disabled will be ignored.

## API

To view the list of properties and their ingestion status via the API, you can use [`/v1/admin/integrations/:integration_id/properties`](https://docs.propexo.com/api-reference/api-reference/admin/get-all-my-property-configurations).
If you want to change the status of one of these properties, you can use [`/v1/admin/integrations/:integration_id/properties/:property_configuration_id`](https://docs.propexo.com/api-reference/api-reference/admin/update-a-property-configuration).
Note that the last path parameter isn't the property ID, it's the id of the property configuration, which is identified by the `id` field on the `GET` endpoint.

For example, if we received the following list of properties from our `GET` endpoint:

<CodeBlock title="Example Payload">
```json
[
  {
    "id": "ce88631d4ccaaf39966fc5907b00b4782",
    "created_at": "2023-12-17T16:04:02.000Z",
    "integration_id": "c4d912598f9c01516794f5a25c285fa41",
    "property_id": "c4d912598f9c01516794f5a25c285fa41:meadow:meadow",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "id": "c9ad28d1f8a9e78522bd89567ce8a13a6",
    "created_at": "2023-12-17T16:04:02.000Z",
    "integration_id": "c4d912598f9c01516794f5a25c285fa41",
    "property_id": "c4d912598f9c01516794f5a25c285fa41:hills:hills",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```
</CodeBlock>

And we wanted to stop ingesting data for property id `c4d912598f9c01516794f5a25c285fa41:hills:hills`, we would get it's property configuration id (`c9ad28d1f8a9e78522bd89567ce8a13a6`) and make the following request:

```
PUT `/v1/admin/integrations/c4d912598f9c01516794f5a25c285fa41/properties/c9ad28d1f8a9e78522bd89567ce8a13a6

{
  "enabled": false
}
```

This would stop future processing of records related to the property with id `c4d912598f9c01516794f5a25c285fa41:hills:hills`.
That means we won't read any data about units, residents, leases, etc when they're related to that property.

## Website

The list of properties for an integration can be viewed on that integration's page, near the bottom.

![Enabled Properties Table](https://propify-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/enabled-properties-table.png)

Each property that belongs to the integration is listed, along with whether it is disabled or not.
If you go to the elipsis on the right side, you can choose to enabled or disable the property.

![Disable Property Button](https://propify-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/enabled-properties-ellipsis.png)

![Disable Property Modal](https://propify-public-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/enabled-properties-disable-modal.png)

Once this is changed, the next sync for this integration will take these new settings into account.
