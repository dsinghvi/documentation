## Overview

When making requests to the Propexo API, you will need to pass proper authentication headers so that you can identify yourself as an authorized user.

<CodeBlock title ="auth header">
```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
```
</CodeBlock>

To get an authorization token, talk to [sales](https://propexo.com/schedule-a-call).
