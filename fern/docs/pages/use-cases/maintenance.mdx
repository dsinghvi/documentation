## Description

If your company fulfills service requests filed by residents or site staff within a property management system, you will need to ingest these service requests on an ongoing basis and then update them as you resolve the issues.

## Steps

**Read an existing service request**

**Update service request**

        <CodeBlock title="PUT /<service_request_id>">
                ```bash
        curl --request PUT \
        --url 'https://api.propexo.com/v1/service-requests/<service_request_id>' \
        --data '{
            "service_request_category_id": "a06c0231-3977-4114-b52c-b81b234c2831",
            "service_request_vendor_id": "6f431e3a-f5f5-4950-8a4d-517c46f1f229",
            "service_description": "There is a leak in the kitchen.",
            "phone_1": "123-123-1234",
            "email_1": "test@test.com",
            "scheduled_start_date": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
            "due_date": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z"
        }'
        ```
                </CodeBlock>


**Any employees, vendors, and/or residents associated with the service request will be able to see these updates within the property management system if they have access to the specific fields that were updated.**
