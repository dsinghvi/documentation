## Relevant Business Types

Resident benefits & amenities, rent payments, security deposit alternatives, services that charge resident a fee.

## Description

Your business may find it valuable to add charges directly to a resident's payment ledger. This allows residents to pay for your service from within the property management software while you can collect fees from the property management company. 

## Steps

**Proptech generates a charge with associated metadata**
<CodeBlock title="Example transaction for $50.00">
```bash 
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.propexo.com/v1/resident-charges \
  --data '{
    "integration_id": "<integration_id>",
    "transaction_date": "2023-07-15",
    "reference_number": "abc-789",
    "notes": "This is a charge for pet insurance",
    "amount_in_cents": 650000
}'
```
</CodeBlock>

**That charge is pushed into the resident payment ledger, and will be collected by the property manager via their payment portal**
