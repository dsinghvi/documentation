## Navigating Propexo's Pricing: How Records Processed Affects Your Bill

Propexo's pricing model is straightforward and transparent, focusing on the number of records processed. This method ensures that the costs directly reflect the data handling services provided to your business. Here's a detailed look at how Propexo calculates your bill and the factors that influence the overall cost.

### The Basics of Propexo's Billing

The core principle behind Propexo's billing is the count of records processed, such as residents and leases. For example:

- During the first sync, if Propexo processes 1,000 residents and 500 leases, and then in a subsequent sync, it processes 1,050 residents and 525 leases, the total records processed would be 3,075 (1,000 + 500 + 1,050 + 525).

### What Influences Your Bill?

The cost can be influenced by several key factors, including:

1. **Sync Frequency**: The frequency at which your data is synchronized can significantly impact the number of records processed. More frequent syncs result in higher record counts.

2. **Date Filters**: The scope of historical data required can also affect the record count. Accessing several years of data will naturally involve more records than retrieving just the latest information. Propexo uses date filters where possible to minimize the data fetched, although this depends on the PMS API's capabilities.

### Scaling with Your Business

Propexo's pricing model is designed to scale with your business. As your data requirements grow or change, the billing adjusts accordingly, offering you flexibility and control over your data management costs.

### Conclusion

By aligning its pricing with the number of records processed, Propexo ensures you have a clear understanding of your data management expenses. This approach provides the transparency needed to make informed decisions and plan your data strategies effectively, ensuring you get value-aligned services that grow with your business needs.
